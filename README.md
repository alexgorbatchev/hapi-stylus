[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/hapi-stylus.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/hapi-stylus)

A basic [Stylus] plugin for [hapi].

## Installation

    npm install hapi-stylus

## Running tests

    $ npm install
    $ npm test

## Usage Example

In a server:

    server.pack.register({
      plugin: require('hapi-stylus'),
      options: {
        home: __dirname + "/styles",
        route: "/styles/{filename*}" // default
      }
    }, done);

In a plugin:

    var register = function(plugin, options, next) {
      plugin.register({
        plugin: require('hapi-stylus'),
        options: {
          home: __dirname + "/styles",
          route: "/styles/{filename*}" // default
        }
      });
      next();
    };
    
With the above configuration you can now `GET /styles/foo.css` or `GET /styles/sub/bar.css` which will look for `__dirname/styles/foo.styl` and `__dirname/styles/sub/bar.styl` respectively.

## Options

### home

Path in which all styles files are located. Plugin will make all attempts to avoid path hacks and will server 404 for all files outside that folder.

### route

Defaults to `/styles/{filename*}`. All paths matching this route will be considered CSS files. `.css` extension gets replaced with `.styl`. Also, `filename` has to be present in the route.

## Notes

Please note that the plugin doesn't do any caching by itself.
